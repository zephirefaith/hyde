title: We wrote about our assembly system
---

We spent a good amount of last year building a dual-arm system capable of assembling a
product made of known parts and of known/defined design. This work was funded by RPDC 
and we developed the system under the name "RPDC Robotics" for the 2021 Assembly
Challenge at World Robot Summit 2020 (now postponed to Summer 2021). You can check out
our reports on Arxiv:
